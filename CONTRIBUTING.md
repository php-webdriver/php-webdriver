# Contributing to php-webdriver

We love to have your help to make php-webdriver better!
 
Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/issues) if you run into any problem, or
send a pull request (see bellow) with your contribution.

## Workflow when contributing a patch

1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. Implement your code changes into separate branch
3. Make sure all PHPUnit tests passes and code-style matches PSR-2 (see below). We also have Travis CI build which will automatically run tests on your pull request.
4. When implementing notable change, fix or a new feature, add record to Unreleased section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
5. Submit your [pull request](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/pulls) against community branch
 
Note before any pull request can be accepted, a [Contributors Licensing Agreement](https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/cla) must be signed.

When you are going to contribute, please keep in mind that this webdriver client aims to be as close as possible to other languages Java/Ruby/Python/C#.
FYI, here is the overview of [the official Java API](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/)

### Run unit tests

There are two test-suites: one with unit tests only, second with functional tests, which require running selenium server.

To execute all tests simply run:

    ./vendor/bin/phpunit

If you want to execute just the unit tests, run:

    ./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit

For the functional tests you must first [download](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) and start
the selenium standalone server, start the local PHP server which will serve the test pages and then run the `functional`
test suite:

    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar -log selenium.log &
    php -S localhost:8000 -t tests/functional/web/ &
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite functional
    
The functional tests will be started in HtmlUnit headless browser by default. If you want to run them in eg. Firefox,
simply set the `BROWSER` environment variable:

    ...
    export BROWSER_NAME="firefox"
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite functional

### Check coding style

Your code-style should comply with [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). To make sure your code matches this requirement run:

    composer codestyle:check

To auto-fix the codestyle simply run:

    composer codestyle:fix
